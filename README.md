# mini scalar repro

This repo includes a lot of webpack config because the first issue we were reproducing was related to WP module federation.

Otherwise, should be totally minimal.

Includes hardcoded openapi for swagger petstore.

We have configured hideModels: true, but still see the models rendered in API Reference.

``` npm start ```
